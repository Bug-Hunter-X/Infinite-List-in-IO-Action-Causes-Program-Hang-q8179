The solution involves using `generate` to create the list and using `take` to consume a finite portion. The `take` function explicitly forces evaluation of a finite prefix of the infinite list.

```haskell
import Control.Monad (forever, replicateM)

generate :: Int -> [Int]
generate n = replicateM n (return 1)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  xs <- generate 5
  print (take 5 xs)
```

This revised code generates a list of 5 ones and then prints the first 5 elements. It avoids the infinite loop by explicitly limiting the list generation.  The `replicateM` function is crucial here to control the length of the list that's generated.
